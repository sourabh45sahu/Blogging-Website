# Blogging-Website
Our blogging website is more than just a digital space; it's a dynamic community where diverse voices converge to share, inspire, and connect.
In this project, a user can sign up and log in to the blogging website to post blogs and view other users' blogs. A user can post blogs according to different categories such as fashion, food, adventure, and travel. My project has a minimalistic design that is easy for the user to understand.  
Technologies Used: Jinja2 syntax, CSS, Javascript(JQuery) for the frontend part of this web application, Django and SQLite3 as the Backend.
